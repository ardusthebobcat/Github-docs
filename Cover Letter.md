To Whom It May Concern,

P1:  State the position you are applying for, tell why you are interested in the position and/or the company, and give a quick overview of why you are qualified

I am applying for the <position> position at <company>.


P2: Tell your pre-Epicodus story: how you became interested in development, and the non-technical skills you picked up before Epicodus. Make sure these non-technical skills match the non-technical skills the job description requests.

I became interested in development from a very early age. Before I could walk, I could guide my dad through levels on video games (something I did quite passionately). As I grew up, I learned different sides of tech. I learned about how to assemble and maintain desktop computers in the days of Windows 95/98, worked with Microsoft Frontpage when it was still packed into the MS Office suite, and enrolled in various programming classes throughout my educational career. Before working with Ruby, I have used: Visual Basic (version 6), Java, HTML, CSS, a few tidbits of Javascript, a little C#, and SQL (generating custom queries in Access using SQL commands). I can safely say that programming is something that has always spoken to me. I eventually learned that coding isn't the only important aspect about programming and that being able to extract and relay information and directions is an equally important skill. My waiter experience taught me how to interact with people that I didnt know, dont get along with, or share other communication barriers.

P3: Talk about your experience at Epicodus, and make sure to match the skills you talk about with the skills listed in the job description.

We worked in pairs to teach ourselves and create apps that meet certain specifications. Each pair of students works on 1+ projects per day for a full 8 hours in a collaborative environment. We learn to manage time, practice debugging ours and other people's code, and complete the lesson-cirriculum, ending with a weekly solo-code project at the end of the week.

P4: Close out with a short summary of why you're a good fit, and thank them for reviewing your application.

My long-term passion for coding and my newly gained experience makes me a good fit for <position>. What I don't have in formal coding experience, I make up for with my desire to succeed and learn. Thank you for your time and your considerations.


Sincerely,



Michael Summers
